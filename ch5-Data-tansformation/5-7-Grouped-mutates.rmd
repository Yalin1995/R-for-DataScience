Grouping is most useful in conjunction with `summarise()`, but you can also do convenient operations with `mutate()` and `filter()`:

* Find the worst members of each group:

```{r}
flights_sml %>% 
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  filter(min_rank(desc(arr_delay)) < 2)
```

* Find all groups bigger than a threshold:

```{r}
popular_dests <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  filter(n() > 17200)

head(popular_dests)
```
* Standardise to compute per group metrics:

```{r}
head(popular_dests %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
  mutate(prop_delay = arr_delay / sum(arr_delay)) %>% 
  select(year:day, dest, arr_delay, prop_delay))
```

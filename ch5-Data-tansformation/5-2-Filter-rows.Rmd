# 5.2 Filter rows with `filter()`

`filter()` allows you to subset observations based on their values.
* The first argument is the name of the data frame.
* The second and subsequent arguments are the expressions that filter the data frame. 

For example, we can select all flights on January 1st with:

```{r}
head(filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1))
```
R either prints out the results, or saves them to a variable. **If you want to do both, you can wrap the assignment in parentheses:**

```{r}
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```

## Comparisons
To use filtering effectively, you have to know how to select the observations that you want using the comparison operators.

R provides the standard suite: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal).

* When you’re starting out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to use `=` instead of `==` when testing for equality. 

* There’s another common problem you might encounter when using` ==: `floating point numbers. These results might surprise you!

```{r}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
```

**Computers use finite precision arithmetic **(they obviously can’t store an infinite number of digits!) so remember that every number you see **is an approximation**. Instead of relying on `==`, use` near()`:

```{r}
near(sqrt(2) ^ 2,  2)
```

## 5.2.2 Logical operators

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with “and”: every expression must be true in order for a row to be included in the output. For other types of combinations, you’ll need to use Boolean operators yourself: `&` is “and”, `|` is “or”, and `!` is “not”.

The following code finds all flights that **departed in November or December**:

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```

A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. **This will select every row where x is one of the values in y**. We could use it to rewrite the code above:

```{r}
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering `De Morgan’s law`:
* `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`
* `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`

For example, if you wanted to find flights that weren’t delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

```{r message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```

## 5.2.3 Missing values

One important feature of R that can make comparison tricky are missing values, or `NA`s (“not availables”). 

```{r}
NA > 5
```
```{r}
NA == NA
```

```{r}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA

# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA

# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
#> [1] NA
# We don't know!
```

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`:

```{r}
is.na(x)
```

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`
*  it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values.
If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
```

```{r}
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

## 5.2.4 Exercises

Find all flights that

### 1.Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

```{r}
head(filter(flights,flights$arr_delay >= 120))
```

### 2. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)

```{r}
head(filter(flights,flights$dest %in% c('IAH','HOU')))
```

### 3. Were operated by `United`, `American`, or `Delta`

```{r}
head(filter(flights,flights$carrier %in% c('AA','UA','DL')))
```
### 4. Departed in summer (`July`, `August`, and `September`)

```{r}
tail(filter(flights,month %in% c(7,8,9)))
```

### 5.Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late

```{r}
tail(filter(flights,(flights$arr_delay> 120) & (flights$dep_delay == 0)))
```

### 6. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. 

```{r}
?between
```

```{r}
tail(between(flights$month,1,3))
```
